This is a straightforward implementation of basic banking services, including account creation and money transfers. It has been developed for educational purposes to explore various types of automated testing.

### How to run it locally?

It is fairly simple thanks to docker. Simply run this command after **cloning the repository**.

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

That's all! Now simply hit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and enjoy using the app.
